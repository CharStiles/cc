**Day 4**
SHADER DAY!!!

Homework:
Create a shader-based visual piece using the provided homework4.html template. Experiment with the shader code, modify the cosPalette parameters, and explore different visual effects using GLSL shaders.

Resources:

* [🌈 Here is Inigo Quilez's page for 2D SDF](https://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/distfunctions2d/distfunctions2d.htm)
* [🧮 Here is an online graphing calculator, very helpful when writing shaders]( https://www.desmos.com/calculator)
* [🎨 Here is the cosPalette function graphed out](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/18rq4ybrru)
* 🌈 the shader we wrote together but in [TouchDesigner]()

Next Steps for shader programming:

💜 Join a community!
Shader.Zone is a safe and inclusive discord to talk about shaders, tools, generative art, and more! Started by my friends Conner Bell and Patricio Gonzalez Vivo: https://shader.zone/

💜 p5js shader examples!
Aman Ferris made [a collection of p5.js shaders](https://github.com/aferriss/p5jsShaderExamples/)

💚 Learn the maths from The Book of Shaders
If you haven't looked at this already, look through it! It's wonderfully paced and has a lot of versatile useful information: https://thebookofshaders.com/

**Day 3**

In class we went over:

* Golan's banded [clock](https://editor.p5js.org/golan/sketches/SkjKxM8DX)
* clock [made in class](https://editor.p5js.org/Char/sketches/EqO0ueH4g)
* Char's mischevious [clock](https://editor.p5js.org/Char/sketches/UVFhMZggD)
* Dan Shiffman [video on making a clock ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4RyStef-gY) and the [clock he made](https://editor.p5js.org/codingtrain/sketches/2lvHFWPbW)
* Dan Shiffman's [slitscan](https://editor.p5js.org/Char/sketches/6_PHNga52)
* Dan Shiffman's youtube [channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain)
* fractal [tree clock sketch](https://editor.p5js.org/Char/sketches/6uJSTGSet)


homework:

Design a "visual clock" that displays a novel or unconventional representation of the time. Your clock should appear different at all times of the day, and it should repeat its appearance every 24 hours (or other relevant cycle, if desired). Challenge yourself to convey the time without numerals.
You are encouraged to question basic assumptions about how time is mediated and represented. Ponder concepts like biological time (chronobiology), ultradian and infradian rhythms, solar and lunar cles, celestial time and sidereal time, decimal time, metric time, geological time, historical time, psychological time, and subjective time. Inform your design by reading about the history of timekeeping systems and devices and their transformative effects on society

Learning Objectives
• Review and research historical methods, devices, and systems for timekeeping
• Devise graphic concepts and technologies for representing time that go beyond conventional methods of visualization and mediation
• Use programming to design, through the control of shape, color, form, and motion
• Apply motion graphics techniques to the representation of temporal

**Day 2**

In class we went over:

* using the noise function
* changing shapes (using triangle)
* changing the color mode
* adding an image
* [Sketch that uses coordinate system and images](https://editor.p5js.org/Char/sketches/DQt1VowIo)
* [sketch that uses noise and shapes](https://editor.p5js.org/Char/sketches/60Ncecfoy)

Homework:

Create a generative art piece. Think about how the functions we used in class can be used differently than we used them. 

**Day 1**

In class assignment: Make a website together!

* make a github account & write your username in the zoom chat
* accept the invitation to collaborate on this repo
* then open command prompt or terminal application and type ```cd ~/Documents``` hit enter
* then type ```git clone https://github.com/CharStiles/cc.git``` and hit enter
* then type ``` cd cc``` and hit enter
* then type ```mkdir yourName``` where yourName is your name, and hit enter
* then type ```git add .``` and hit enter
* then type ```git commit -m "added my folder"``` and hit enter
* then type ```git push``` and hit enter
 
Then you should see your folder appear on this page!

Homework:
modify an existing p5.js sketch, credit where you got it in a comment at the top, create an index.html page in your folder and add the sketch to that index.html 

Where you can find existing p5.js sketches: 
* we looked at this one in class: [https://editor.p5js.org/Char/sketches/XHy8RcZ-j]
* [https://showcase.p5js.org/#/2022-All]
* [https://openprocessing.org/]
* search online like github
